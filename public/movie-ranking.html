<h2>In No Particular Order</h2>

<h2>Poor Things</h2>
<p>One of the most optimistic movies I've watched in long time.</p>
<h2>Godzilla: Minus One</h2>
<p>A very touching take on the origin of Godzilla. While previously it was a reflection of nuclear war fears, it has become grief.</p>
<h2>Talk To Me</h2>
<p>Solid horror movie. Greatly enjoyed. Horrible wigs.</p>
